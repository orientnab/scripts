# scripts
A bunch of short scripts.

## jumpToDir
Function to jump to a directory using fzf.
It needs to be sourced in your terminal configuration file (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc).

## picOfTheDayNatGeo
It downloads the [Picture of the Day](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-of-the-day/) from NatGeo.
And sets it as the background in KDE Plasma.

The last step of the script can be modified to work in other environments.

It can be automated using `cron` or `anacron`.
